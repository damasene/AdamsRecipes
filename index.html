    <h1>Three Recipes from Memory</h1>
    
    <h4>With totally unrelated photographs by Elis Ing</h4>
    
    <p>These are three dishes I make often, without referring to a recipe. Measurements and timings are approximate. I adjust my own cooking methods as I go and if you want to follow these recipes you'll need to do the same. However, they're simple and forgiving recipes, with no advanced techniques required. And they're good eating!</p>
