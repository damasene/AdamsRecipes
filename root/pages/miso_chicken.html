    <h2>Miso-glaze roast chicken</h2>

    <p>If you eat meat, it's hard not to love roast chicken &mdash; but this miso, butter, and honey glaze takes it to the <i>next level</i>. This is adapted from lots of recipes available online. </p>
    <p>Serves 4</p>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Medium-sized chicken (3-4 lbs)</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp red or white miso<li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp softened butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>Squeeze of lemon juice (1-2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>


    </ul>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375f.</p>

    <P>Crush the garlic or chop it finely if you don't have a garlic crusher. Put all the ingredients except the chicken into a bowl and blend into a loose paste. A fork is usually the best tool for this.</P>

    <p>If the chicken's legs are tied together, untie them. With a butter knife or silicone spatula, spread the miso-butter all over the chicken, inside and out. Really get in there.</p>

    <p>Roast at 375f for about 35 minutes, basting twice. Turn the oven up to 420f for the last 10-15 minutes. But your oven might be hotter or cooler than mine so check often and adjust accordingly.</p>
