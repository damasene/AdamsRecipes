    <h2>Crisp gnocchi salad</h2>

    <p>Adapted from a Nigel Slater recipe in the Guardian. This is an unexpected, summery way to use those cheap packets of gnocchi that otherwise tend to end up in stodgy tomato and cheese dishes.</p>
    <p>Serves 2.</p>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 packet of gnocchi (about 500g)</li>
        <li>7-8 fresh radishes</li>
        <li>About 3 inches of an English cucumber</li>
        <li>Two green onions or one small white onion</li>
        <li>Handful of cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>Handful of flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>Sprig of fresh mint</li>
        <li>Clove of garlic</li>
        <li>Half a lemon</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, dried chilli flakes</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Open the packet of gnocchi. They tend to stick together, so use your hands to break them apart into a bowl. When the water is boiling, add the gnocchi and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Quickly drain the gnocchi and toss them with a little olive oil in a mixing bowl.</p>

    <p>Clean and trim the radishes, then cut into quarters (or approximately the size of the gnocchi, if they're large). Leaving the skin on, cut the cucumber into similar-sized chunks. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. If you're using green onions, chop them finely along with the herbs.</p>

    <p>Finely chop the garlic (and roughly chop the white onion, if using), and keep seperate from the other vegetables.</p>

    <p>Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a cast iron or non-stick frying pan over a moderate heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the chopped garlic and stir for about 30 seconds. Add the white onion, if using, and fry for another 30 seconds to a minute. Add the cooked gnocchi to the pan. Cook for about 11-14 minutes, stirring occasionally. Try to get a crust on all sides. If they're sticking, add a bit more oil and lower the heat slightly. When the gnocchi are golden brown, empty the pan into a large bowl and leave them for 5-10 minutes to cool.</p>

    <p>When the gnocchi and garlic/onion is warm but not blazing hot, toss them with the chopped veggies, fresh herbs, salt, pepper, and chilli flakes (to taste) lemon juice, and a glug of olive oil. Serve immediately.</p>
